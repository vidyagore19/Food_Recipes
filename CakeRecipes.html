						<b>-</b> There are many different types of cake recipes and numerous ways of categorizing them. The general classification used is whether or not they contain fat, also known as shortening.<br><br>

						<b>-</b>Cakes lend themselves to limitless variations depending on the proportion of their ingredients, the way they are mixed, flavorings added to the basic ingredients, the shapes of the pans used in baking, and cooling and storing methods. Any number of fillings, frosting and final decorations can be chosen to make every cake unique and an artistic expression of its maker. 
                     <br><br>

						<b>-</b> Cakes have around since the time of the ancient Egyptians, and are believed to have been more like sweetened bread with the addition of honey, nuts and dried fruits than like the cake we know today.  (It may also may refer to any round, flat disk of food, such as a pancake or even a yeasted sweet (coffee) cake, discussed in other sections.)

										Before you make the eggless vanilla cake recipe, get all your ingredients ready.
                                        Make sure all of them are at room temperature, except the butter that can be cold or straightaway removed from the refrigerator.
										step-1:First add 1.5 cups of all purpose flour with 1 tsp of baking powder and a pinch of salt into a sieve placed over a mixing bowl.<br><br>
										step-2: Sift the dry ingredients once or twice. Set aside.<br><br>
										step-3: Grease a 7.5 or 8 inches round pan with some butter.You can line the pan with parchment if you prefer.
                                        One of my ancient (but really sturdy and well-seasoned) baking pan.<br><br>
										step-4:Heat slightly more than ½ cup of butter in a small pan or bowl on medium-low heat until it just melts.<br><br>
										step-5: Measure the melted butter in a ½ cup measuring cup. Set aside. Preheat your oven to 190 degrees Celsius (375 degrees Fahrenheit) for 15 to 20 minutes before baking. <br><br>
										step-6:In another bowl add ¾ cup of raw sugar (or white sugar), 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, ¼ cup of curd (yogurt) and 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.<br><br>
										step-7:Add ½ cup of water.<br><br>
										step-8:Whisk briskly until all of the sugar is dissolved and the curd gets evenly mixed. It should be like buttermilk, slightly off-color and foamy.
                                        It is important that you beat the curd before adding as mentioned above so that you don’t have tiny lumps of curd in this liquid mixture.<br><br>
										step-9: Now add ½ teaspoon of baking soda to the wet mixture.<br><br>
										step-10:Stir until the baking soda is mixed evenly. The baking soda will cause some bubbling in this wet liquid mixture.<br><br>
										step-11:Add the liquid mixture and melted butter to the dry sifted ingredients.<br><br>
										step-12:Mix very well with a wired whisk. Break apart any lumps by tapping them with the whisk. Be careful not to over-mix the batter. <br><br>
										step-13:It should be a smooth batter<br><br>
										step-14:Pour the batter into the greased pan. Tap the pan on the countertop a few times so that any extra air bubbles are released and the batter spreads itself evenly in the pan.
                                        You do not need to even the batter with a spatula. The batter spreads on its own.<br><br>
										step-15: Place the cake pan in the preheated oven on the middle rack. If using an OTG or a regular oven, heat both the top and bottom heating elements.<br><br>
										step-16:Bake at 180 degrees Celsius (375 degrees Fahrenheit) for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the top crust is golden.<br><br>
										step-17:Check the doneness of the eggless vanilla cake with a bamboo skewer. It should be clean with no sticky batter on it.<br><br>
										step-18:Place the pan on a wired tray or rack and let the cake cool to room temperature. Let the cake cool completely.and your Veg Valina Base is ready.<br><br>

										step-1:Bake two cake layers of the same size. You may choose round or square cakes, but it's important that the dimensions be exactly the same. Allow the cakes to cool completely.<br><br>
										step-2:
                                        Turn one cake onto a platter. Since the cake will be unwieldy once it is layered and iced, it's best to use the same plate on which you plan to serve the cake.<br><br>
										step-3:
                                        Use a long serrated knife to trim off the rounded top of the cake. Hold the knife parallel to the brim of the cake and slice about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) off the top. Be careful to slice straight across, holding the knife level as you go.<br><br>
                                        Try to create a flat, even surface. This will serve as a base for the second layer.
                                        Remove the rounded top of the cake and discard it, or save it to eat.
                                        Don't attempt to cut off the top of the cake with a small knife, as this will result in an uneven surface.<br><br>
										step-3:
                                        Cover the cake layer with filling. Spoon the filling of your choice onto the bottom layer of the cake. Use the spoon or a knife to spread it around until it covers the entire layer.<br><br>
                                        Raspberry, lemon curd, cream, or chocolate are popular cake fillings.
                                        Try not to let the filling drip over the edges, since you don't want it to mix with the icing.<br><br>
										step-4:
                                        Place the second layer of the cake on top of the first. The flat side of the second layer should be down, and the rounded side should be the top of the cake.<br><br>
                                        If you want the finished cake to have a flat surface instead of a domed one, repeat the process of slicing off the rounded top of the second layer with a serrated knife. Place the cut side down, so that the smooth, flat bottom of the second layer forms the top of the cake.<br><br>
                                        Use a paper towel to wipe away filling that squeezes out when you add the second layer.<br><br>
										step-5:Ice the cake with a crumb coat. For a professional-looking cake, you'll be adding two layers of icing, starting with a "crumb coat" that serves as a base to catch all the crumbs, so the second layer looks clean and crumb-free.[5] Use the recipe above or your own icing recipe to ice the cake with a butter knife.
                                        The crumb coat needn't have flavor or color, unless you'd like it to. You can use plain white icing.<br><br>
                                        Be sure to ice the entire cake, including the sides. Take care not to get too much filling mixed in with the icing.<br><br>
                                        It's OK if the crumb coat doesn't look perfect - the point is simply to cover the entire cake and trap in the crumbs.<br><br>
                                        Allow the crumb coat to set for half an hour before continuing.<br><br>
										step-6:
                                        Ice the cake with a final layer of icing. Using the recipe above or your own icing recipe, ice the cake once more with a final pretty layer.<br><br>
                                        If desired, add flavor and color to the batch of icing you use for the final layer.<br><br>
                                        Decorate the cake with cut fruit, flowers, or other toppings, then allow it to set before eating.<br><br>
										step-7:
                                        Finished.<br><br>

										step-1:Preparation. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.<br><br>
										step-2:Combine the dry ingredients. Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Mix it until well combined.<br><br>
										step-3:Whisk the wet ingredients. Mix the brown sugar, melted butter, and oil in a medium bowl. Add the eggs one by one, mixing after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.<br><br>
										step-4:Combine the wet and dry ingredients. Alternate adding the wet ingredients and milk to the dry mix, starting and finishing with the dry mixture. Mix it just until it’s blended. Stir in 1 cup of the chocolate chips.<br><br>
										step-5:Fill the muffin tin. Scoop the batter evenly into the muffin cups, filling each about 3/4 full. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of chocolate chips on top of each muffin.<br><br>
										step-6:Bake the muffins at 425°F for 5 minutes, then lower the heat to 350°F. Bake them for another 15 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.<br><br>
										step-8:Cool the muffins in the tin for 10 minutes, then move them to a wire rack until they’re fully cooled. Dig in and enjoy!<br><br>

										step-1:Preheat the oven:
                                        Preheat the oven to 450°F. Use your hands to lightly grease the inside of four 6-ounce ramekins with butter.<br><br>
										step-2:Fill a medium pot with about 2 inches of water. Set it over medium-high heat to bring the water to a gentle boil. Place a medium heat-proof bowl on top of the pot. The boiling water should not touch the bottom of the bowl. This is called a double boiler.<br><br>
                                        Add the chocolate chips and butter to the bowl and use a rubber spatula to mix until melted. Set it aside to cool for 5 to 10 minutes.<br><br>
										step-3:Combine the wet ingredients:
                                        In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, egg yolks, vanilla, and salt. When the chocolate mixture feels cool to the touch, scrape it into the egg mixture. Stir to combine.<br><br>
										step-4:Add the flour:
                                        Whisk in the flour until just combined. The batter will be thick, so you can switch to a rubber spatula if needed.<br><br>
										step-5:Divide the batter evenly into the prepared ramekins and place the ramekins on a baking sheet. Bake for 11 to 12 minutes, until the edges are firm and the centers are still soft. Carefully and gently poke the center of a lava cake with a finger. It should be jiggly, not fully set. If it is still liquidy (you’ll have wet batter on your finger), bake for an additional 1 to 2 minutes.<br><br>
										step-6:Let the lava cakes cool for 3 minutes before serving.<br><br>
                                        To invert the lava cake: Cover a ramekin with an inverted dessert plate. Carefully flip the ramekin upside down and let it stand for a few seconds. Lift the ramekin to unmold the lava cake. Repeat with the remaining lava cakes while they are still warm.<br><br>
                                        I recommend that you eat your lava cakes warm, soon after they come out of the oven. The molten center will start to solidify as it cools.<br><br>
                                        The lava cakes can be served à la mode with vanilla ice cream, with a dusting of powdered sugar or cocoa powder, or with other toppings like fresh berries, chopped nuts, and caramel sauce.<br><br>
