						<td>Marinated fish is seared on a pan and then cooked brifly in the prepared curry. </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Step-3</td>
						<td>A lot of people add the fish directly to the simmering curry.but we personally prefer to marinate and sear first as this cuts down the fishy smell.though this step is optional.I highly recomment this if you are new to seafood curries and stews. </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Step-4</td>
						<td>I prefer to blend the onion tomato masala to give the curry/gravy a thicker texture with superior flavors.this is what makes this dish the best.  </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Step-5</td>
						<td>this recipe uses a small amount of coconut. you can use fresh grated or frozen coconut or coconut milk.if you do not consume coconut,you may simply leave out that subtitute with cashews.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Step-6</td>
						<td>this recipe is easily adoptable and you can play around with the incredients.if you love tamarind in your fish curry, feel free to add some while you make the curry.you also squeeze some lemon juice before serving.to use amchur, add it at the finishing stage.</td>
